# Welcome to ZentaChain

ZentaChain technology allows distributed retention of encrypted data and is at the heart of cooperative Zenta Cloud storage.
Zentachain is a high-throughput blockchain platform designed to scale to thousands of transactions per second.(TPS)
It is a blockchain platform that can support dapps and process thousands of transactions per second.
This high transaction throughput relies on a scalability solution called sharding.
First is will its Efficient Sharding technology, a scalability solution that securely dynamically partitions
the blockchain. As a result of, zentachain will it to achieve greater than 100,000 transactions per second.


#### How does the Decentralized Memory work with ZentaChain ?

Distributed memory combines the best features of blockchain technology with attributes that meet the practical requirements of storing large amounts of data. As the name indicates, remote storage works by distributing the data across a network of ZentaChain nodes, similar to the distributed ledger of blockchain technology.

#### Why you should not trust a Cloud.

Currently, individual systems and even cloud-based databases are highly centralized.  This makes it a lighthouse for hackers who want to attack. You also have obvious sources of system errors if a controlling company should be affected, for example, as a result of a power failure.
In contrast, distributed storage does address these issues by using geographically distributed ZentaChain nodes either regionally or globally.


#### The problem with Blockchain.

While distributed memory shows some of the key features of the blockchain, we also need to think about how to store data "on the blockchain".
As blockchain was flooded with transactions, they too had to look for solutions to the problem of scalability.
The concept of storing large amounts of data on the blockchain is simply not plausible.

#### What is sharding how will it work on ZentaChain?

#### The Solution of ZentaChain

##### Sarding:

Sharding by splitting up every block into a number of shards,each node in a network can process its own shard which later on will be  compiled back into the final zentachain-block.
In that way every zentachain-block takes around 2 minutes to be completely  processed. 

Compared to Bitcoin, which consists of one block that takes 10 minutes to be verified and processed. ZENTACHAIN ​​is designed in such a way that the block needs about two minutes per confirmation. ZENTACHAIN ​​is much faster! Another issue  with Bitcoin is that virtually all miners work on one block at the same time, ZENTACHAIN ​​believes that the work is, so to speak, subordinate and much more divided. When you divide its core into much smaller departments (blocks), you then have the possibility to process many more transactions simultaneously.

For example: take 100 people, who each work in groups of ten. Each group of the ten works on their own project (ie. transactions) or their own task within the blockchain. In the end all results are compiled and placed on the main block (ZENTACHAIN), in this case is number 1, as You can see here in this diagram ZentaChain  in green . The sharded  ZentaChain block takes 2 minutes per block vs the whole bitcoin block which takes 10 minutes to complete each confirmation 

ZENTACHAIN has several advantages over other blockchains:
1.) The confirmation does not take as long as other blockchains ie. Bitcoin
2) if a transaction utilizes the micro blocks, you'll get a confirmation in seconds. The micro blocks are more efficient because the work is divided. The More blocks you have the faster and greater the transaction process becomes.  
3.) This leads to a significantly greater scalability

##### What is Swarm?

Swarm is a distributed storage platform and content distribution service, a native base layer service of the web3 stack.
The primary objective of swarm is to provide sufficiently decentralized and redundant storage of ZentaChain's public information.
In particular, to store and distribute dapp code and data as well as blockchain data.
Economically, it allows participants to efficiently pool their storage and bandwidth resources.
To provide these services to all participants in the network.


Two key technologies help to solve these problems. 
The first of these is sharding, where databases are partitioned by logical lines.
In a distributed storage model, these shards are stored together and retrieved by a remote application with a unique partition key.

The collective storage of shards is achieved through the second complementary technology known as swarm.
Just as blockchain uses a network of nodes, the distributed storage uses large groups of nodes - the so-called "swarm" to store and manage data.

The swarm effect reduces latency and increases speed by retrieving data in parallel from the next and fastest nodes, much like torrents.
Because there are many geographically dispersed nodes in a swarm, their reliability and scalability increase.

Most significant to current data storage providers, the devices in the nodes and swarms are not owned by a single company.
They are owned and controlled by individuals without any regulatory authority or a company that keeps their data.

From the end user's point of view, swarm does not differ significantly from the World Wide Web, except that uploads are not hosted on a particular server.
Swarm provides a peer-to-peer storage and server solution that is DDoS-resistant, has no downtime, is fault-tolerant and censorship-resistant, and carries itself.
Thanks to an integrated incentive system that uses peer-to-peer solutions.

##### Zenta2p2
Zenta2P2’ is decentralized messenger with p2p  blockchain & IPFS .
ZentaChain is a secure, decentralized messenger with an integrated payment system.
ZentaChain can not be disabled or blocked because it does not have centralized servers
and all information is encrypted in a distributed data store (IPFS).

##### what is our vision
Zentachain vision is 
people who don’t trust one another—share valuable data in a secure, tamperproof way. That’s because zentachains store data using sophisticated math and innovative software rules that are extremely difficult for attackers to manipulate.
