# Welcome ZentaChain


Zentachain will a high-throughput blockchain platform designed to scale to thousands of transactions per second.(TPS)
It will be a blockchain platform that can support dapps and process thousands of transactions per second.


This high transaction throughput relies on a scalability solution called sharding,
which was used by the Ethereum development team.


First is will its Efficient Distributed Sharding (EDS) technology, a scalability solution that securely dynamically partitions
the blockchain. As a result of EDS, zentachain will it to achieve greater than 100,000 transactions per second.


## Smart-contracts
As you probably know, smart contracts are written in computer code and run automatically when the terms of the contract are met.
However, this process is not completely automatic because it still requires human inputs to confirm that the conditions are met.
With Zentachain, we will automate the entire process without human intervention. This provides superior efficiency and lack of trust,
as well as incentives for companies to use technology to reduce risk and reduce costs.
